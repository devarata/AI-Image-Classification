# AI-Image-Classification

## Note:
 - main is in dataClassifier.py

## Tocheck:
 - There is no minicontest in Project 5. But there is in Classification. How do we make that?
 

## Issues in files:

### dataClassifier.py
 - Line of code : samples.loadDataFile("facedata/facedatatrain", numTraining,FACE_DATUM_WIDTH,FACE_DATUM_HEIGHT)
 - Issue : There is no such folder. We need to check how to load data.
